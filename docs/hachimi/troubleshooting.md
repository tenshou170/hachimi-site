# Troubleshooting
[[toc]]

## General

### "Communication error" messages when attempting to start the game

- After launching, most users do not need a VPN to connect to the game itself, and it can cause issues instead. Check that you have turned it off or use split tunneling (if supported). **In some regions, you *do* need a VPN to connect**. 
  - You can check by accessing the [official API website](https://api-umamusume.cygames.jp). If you get `404 Not Found`, you don't need a VPN. `Access Denied` means you do.
  - See [this guide](https://gametora.com/umamusume/playing-on-dmm) to get started with VPN, and [this guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18m9wHT4_AIh5ePKSo_ZYH9nSgNh492YQx76bIxmgqyc/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.7cq4imx1gkqf) for an alternative VPN solution.
- If both the **Global Steam** and **Japanese DMM** version of the game are installed, [try the steps for the Error 501 issue](#error-501).

### Physics (hair, clothing, etc.) are stiff when running at 60+ FPS
Change the "Physics update mode" setting to "Mode60FPS". This setting is available in the Config Editor in the "Gameplay" tab.

### Corrupted/jumbled textures or text 

::: tip
If you are playing the **Global** version, you might have accidentally installed translations **not specicially made for Global**.
To fix this, open the Hachimi menu, run the `First time setup` again to choose a compatible source or none, then restart the game.
:::

This happens because there is a mismatch between the game's sprite textures and the translated ones. The most likely reason is the game simply updated and changed some sprites, usually affecting the `atlas` type.

1. Try to update your translations from the menu. If an update was found, restart the game after it finishes.
    - On Android/some devices, you *might* also need to delete the `atlas` folder to let it update correctly.
1. If no update was found, your translation source is out of date. Just wait for an update, or check in with the source.
    - <small>If it's close to a game update, source maintainers will likely be working on it. Please check if they're already aware before bothering them.</small>
1. Your translation source might be entirely inactive. This could indicate you're still using an old source from the original Hachimi.
Make sure you're using Hachimi Edge, then open its menu and go through the `First time setup` again. 
1. The list of sources itself could be outdated, particularly if you upgraded straight from old Hachimi. In this case, you can use `Restore Defaults` to reset it to the latest bundled one. 
    - ⚠️ Warning: This will reset all settings.  

If no active source for your language exists, you can check `Menu` -> `Config Editor` -> `Disable translations` if needed.

### Something isn't translated
Translations are provided by volunteers in the community offering up their time. Many things are not yet done. Check in with your chosen translation source and try to support its translators.

### Lyrics switch between language randomly
~~Unfortunately, this is an unsolved bug introduced by a game update. We are working on it.~~
This bug has been fixed. Update Hachimi to v0.15.1 or later.

### Game won't load beyond the splash screen
If the game **gets stuck** on the splash screen, see [Error 501](#error-501).  
If you can see the splash screen but the game crashes afterward, see [The game won't start after installing Hachimi](#the-game-won-t-start-after-installing-hachimi).

### "Account resricted" message
This means you are banned.

### The in-game background is shrunk / White border
Open Hachimi Menu -> Config Editor and reset `virtual resolution multiplier` to 1. 
If that doen't help, try adjusting it until it looks ok.

### My issue isn't listed on this page
Uninstall Hachmimi using the installer. Try to use the one you installed your current version with, but the latest one should work just fine.
If you have multiple game versions installed, make sure you uninstall from the right path. Then reinstall latest Hachimi Edge.
If that doesn't work, you can ask in the `#help` channel on the [Hachimi Discord](https://discord.gg/BVEt5FcxEn) and clearly explain your issue and what you have tried.


## Windows

### Runtime error on launch

This means you're using an old version of Hachimi, which broke after the game update on 2025/09/24 (JP) and 2025/11/11 (Global). 
[Install Hachimi Edge](getting-started.md).

If you're already using Edge, try reinstalling the latest version.

### The game won't start after installing Hachimi

::: warning
Some kernel-level anti-cheats (such as Vanguard, used in Valorant and League of Legends) prevent Hachimi from launching the game correctly. Make sure they are not running on your computer, then try again.
:::

- Make sure you installed the correct version of Hachimi for your game version (Japanese or Other). You can find the right one on the [getting started](getting-started.md) page.
- Restart your computer after the installer enables DotLocal redirection.  
  **Click "Restart" in the shutdown menu, don't just shut down and turn it back on.**
- If you're using DMM, try restarting the DMM Launcher or force it to always run as administrator.
- If you're using Steam, game updates can replace some modified files. Re-install Hachimi using the installer.
- Navigate to the game's installation folder, right-click the game's exe file, open **Properties**, and try **one or more** of the following in order:
  - Enable `Disable fullscreen optimizations` under the Compatibility tab.
  - Open `Change high DPI settings`, enable `High DPI scaling override`, and set it to `Application`.
- Open `Windows Settings → Display → Graphics`, add the game's exe file there, and tick `Don't use optimizations for windowed games` in its options.

<!-- 
    TODO: add more details about weird edge cases like old unsupported versions of CarrotJuicer?

### Installer: "Code execution cannot proceed / VCRUNTIME" error
Install the latest [VC++ redistributable](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/windows/latest-supported-vc-redist?view=msvc-170) matching your device architecture. If you're unsure, it's 99% likely to be `x64`.

### Steam Global and JP: Issues with GUI/overlay

The Steam overlay can sometimes interfere with Hachimi's overlay. Disable one of them (Steam recommended). 
    
To disable Hachimi's: open the Hachimi menu and check the "Disable overlay (GUI)" checkbox in the "General" tab, press Save, and restart the game. 
When you want to re-enable Hachimi's overlay, open Hachimi's config file (config.json) in a text editor and change the `disable_gui` value from `true` back to `false`, then restart the game. This config file is located in the `hachimi` folder inside the game's installation folder.

### Steam Global: Stuck at start screen
This seems to be a bug in the game itself, which Hachimi causes to trigger much more easily. Use `alt` + `enter` to toggle between fullscreen and windowed. This should let you continue. An official fix is presumably coming.

### DMM: Input registering at the wrong spot on the screen after the window is resized

This is a known issue with Hachimi on the Japanese DMM version of the game (fix coming soon™). For now, just don't resize the window.

### DMM: Can't play certain games after installing Hachimi

The version of Hachimi for the JP DMM version of the game uses DotLocal DLL redirection to load, which some anti-cheats (such as Vanguard, used in Valorant and League of Legends) hate seeing enabled. 
You need to disable DLL redirection whenever you want to play an affected game. 
[DotLocalToggle](https://github.com/LeadRDRK/DotLocalToggle/releases/) is a small program that lets you quickly toggle DotLocal DLL redirection.
Alternatively, play the JP Steam version.

### Input registering at the wrong spots or game resolution appears stretched in full screen mode

::: warning
On the Global client, the `Full screen mode` option generally works as expected, but changing `Resolution scaling` can break rendering and input behavior even at **1080p** resolution.  
It's strongly recommended to **keep `Resolution scaling` at its default value** on the Global version.
:::

- Ensure that the `Full screen mode` and `Resolution scaling` options are set correctly.  
- If your screen resolution is higher than **1080p**, try selecting a different `Resolution scaling` value.  
- If your monitor's aspect ratio is not **16:9**, set `Full screen mode` to **Exclusive** instead.

### Sound issues
This is a bug in the game, not Hachimi. Some users can turn on Windows Sonic without adverse effects to fix it.

### Game stutters
Make sure you don't have auto-translate on in the Hachimi settings. This only works when you have a translation server set up correctly, and will cause performance problems even then.

### Error 501
Both versions use the same data download directory name with different capitalization.
Case sensitivity must be enabled on this directory for them to work together.
::: tip
If you want/need to move manually: To go directly to the game's data directory, use `WinKey + R` and enter `%localappdata%low\Cygames` in the dialog.
Global uses "Umamusume" while JP uses "umamusume".
:::
1. Close the game.
1. Open the `Start Menu`, search for `PowerShell`, choose "Run as Admin".
1. Run the following command: `fsutil.exe file setCaseSensitiveInfo $env:USERPROFILE\AppData\LocalLow\Cygames enable`.
    - If you get `Error: Unsupported action` or similar, first run the following command: `Enable-WindowsOptionalFeature -Online -FeatureName Microsoft-Windows-Subsystem-Linux`, then try again.
    - If you get `Error: The directory is not empty`, temporarily move everything out of the `Cygames` folder, then try again:
    ```powershell
    New-Item -ItemType Directory "$env:USERPROFILE\AppData\LocalLow\CygamesTEMP"
    Move-Item "$env:USERPROFILE\AppData\LocalLow\Cygames\*" "$env:USERPROFILE\AppData\LocalLow\CygamesTEMP"
    ```
1. If you had to empty the Cygames folder, move everything back into it:
    ```powershell
    Move-Item "$env:USERPROFILE\AppData\LocalLow\CygamesTEMP\*" "$env:USERPROFILE\AppData\LocalLow\Cygames"
    Remove-Item "$env:USERPROFILE\AppData\LocalLow\CygamesTEMP"
    ``

### Global Steam and JP DMM versions constantly ask to redownload data
See [Error 501](#error-501) above.

### I/O error: Access is denied (os error 5)
Something is using files you're trying to modify. Likely means you still have the game open while trying to(un)install Hachimi.

### Installer I/O error: The system cannot find the file specified (os error 2)
This is likely to occur on global due to some file name differences not yet accounted for. It shouldn't affect Hachimi and can be safely ignored.

### First time setup: Repo selection stuck loading or shows an error
This probably means you're using a VPN to access the game itself. Temporarily turn it off until the setup is over and translations are downloaded.  
See also the [related issue below](#not-receiving-translation-updates). 

### Not receiving translation updates
First of all, there might not be updates. This should be indicated by a "No updates found" message.
If this message doesn't show, you're probably using a VPN to access the game. Turn it off during the update phase.


## Android

### Patching failed

- Make sure you selected both the **base** and **split APK** files, or the combined **XAPK** file.
  You can tap and hold to select multiple files in the file picker.  
  The recommended place to get the APKs is [Qoopy](https://qoopy.leadrdrk.com/) (use ID **6172**).

- If you're on a **Xiaomi/POCO** device running **MIUI** (not **HyperOS**), try disabling *MIUI Optimizations* from Developer Options, it can sometimes interfere with the installation.
    ::: warning
    Disabling **MIUI Optimizations** will reset **all app permissions** and may cause apps to lose granted access (storage, notifications, etc.).
    :::

- Try clearing the **UmaPatcher Edge** cache:  
  *Hold the app icon → App info → Storage → Cache (if applicable) → Clear cache.*  
  If that doesn't work, try **redownloading UmaPatcher Edge** and **importing the signing key** again.

### App not installed as app isn't compatible error

::: warning
These steps are required for some Samsung devices and involve connecting your phone to a PC. They may also work for other Android devices.
:::

This issue can occur when the game has been *uninstalled* but still remains inside a **Secure Folder**. Follow these steps to completely remove the game:
1. **Enable USB Debugging** on your device from Developer Options.  
   If you don't know how, check this [YouTube Short Guide](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/p7DDuq56suU)
2. **Download and extract** the [Android Platform Tools (ADB)](https://developer.android.com/tools/releases/platform-tools#downloads) ZIP file on your computer.
3. **Open a Terminal** by right-clicking an empty area inside the extracted ADB folder (where `adb.exe` is located) and selecting **Open in Terminal** (or similar).
   - Holding **Shift** while right-clicking in Windows 10 should display the **"Open PowerShell window here"** option.
4. **Connect your device** to the computer via USB (USB-C or any compatible cable).
5. In the Terminal window, type `adb.exe` and press **Enter** to ensure it's recognized.
6. Then type `adb devices` and press **Enter**.  
   Look at your device and **grant USB debugging permission** when prompted, then run the command again to verify the connection.  
   It should display something like `"ABCD1234EFGH" device` in the Terminal.
   If it doesn't, see below.
7. Finally, type `adb uninstall jp.co.cygames.umamusume` and press **Enter** to uninstall the game.

#### Unauthorized device troubleshooting
If typing `adb devices` and pressing **Enter** shows **"unauthorized"** instead of **"device"**:
1. On your device, **disable USB debugging**, then **re-enable** it.
2. Reconnect the device and **grant the USB debugging permission** again when prompted.
3. Repeat the relevant steps above (usually steps 5–7).

### Cannot log in via a Google Play account

You cannot log in to the patched version of the game using a Google Play account and must use a Data Link password instead. 
If you have a Data Link password already created, log in to that account from the title screen (☰ > Data Link). 
If you *don't* have a Data Link password, you will need to uninstall the patched version of the game, reinstall the unpatched version of the game, log in via your Google Play account, then create a Data Link password. 
After that, you can repeat the patching process and then log in using the created Data Link password.
Alternatively, you may log in to a Cygames ID to link your account data.

### この端末でのプレイは許可されていません (You are not permitted to play on this device) error

#### Your device is rooted
 Make sure your connection is stable and that the device is passing at least **DEVICE_INTEGRITY** on the Play Integrity servers (you can verify this using the [Play Integrity API Checker](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=gr.nikolasspyr.integritycheck) app). If it passes, hiding root from the game using **Magisk's built-in DenyList** (enable *Enforce DenyList* if it doesn't work) should make it work. Other tools such as **Shamiko** may also do the trick.

#### Your device is not rooted
 If this error message continues to show on your device, it may indicate an unstable connection to the Play Integrity servers, or that you need to use a **VPN** when launching the game. See the [Communication error](#communication-error-messages-when-attempting-to-start-the-game) section for more details.

### I/O error: Permission denied (os error 13)

This could happen due to the new scoped storage introduced on Android 10, which makes Hachimi fail to create its data directory. 
To workaround this, open your file manager, go to Android/media and create a folder named "jp.co.cygames.umamusume". Relaunch the game and the problem should be fixed.

### I/O error: File exists (os error 17)

Reboot your device and try launching the game again. If the error persists, ask for help in the Discord server.

### Crashing after launch

This might be needed for some devices and emulators:  
Open your file manager and navigate to `Android/media`. Create a folder named "jp.co.cygames.umamusume". 
Inside of that folder, create a folder named "hachimi". Finally, download [this config file](https://files.leadrdrk.com/hachimi/android-compat/config.json) and put it inside the "hachimi" folder (make sure that it's called "config.json").

### Mismatched taps
Open Hachimi's menu -> Config Editor and play with the virtual resolution multiplier to find which value works best.

### Tapping doesn't register, or causes the game to crash or freeze

This issue has been fixed in Hachimi Edge version 0.15.1. Make sure you have [updated](faqs.md#how-do-i-update-the-game-or-hachimi-on-android).

<details>
<summary class="collapsible-header-sub">I'm experiencing this on a version newer than 0.15.1</summary>

:::tip
Turning off the GUI disables translation updates. You'll have to occasionally toggle it on & off again to do so.
:::
1. Make sure your translations are up to date. Let Hachimi update if you can and don't touch anything until it's done.
1. Open Hachimi's menu -> Config Editor and select Disable Overlay (GUI).
    - To re-enable it, open Hachimi's `config.json` file in a text or JSON editor and change the `disable_gui` value from `true` back to `false`, then restart the game. This file is located in `android/media/jp.co.cygames.umamusume/hachimi` (might differ with phone brand).
1. Please report the issue to Hachimi Edge devs on Discord or GitHub.
</details>


### Patched successfully but no translations
Make sure the translations are downloaded and up to date. Run the first time setup again.

If during patching you see a message mentioning `libmain.so` you can try, in order until one works:
1. Make sure you are on the latest Hachimi update.
1. Force redownload Hachimi in the UmaPatcher Edge settings, then patch again.
1. Clear Umapatcher Edge's app cache and data.
1. Reinstall Umapatcher Edge.
1. Restart your device into recovery mode and wipe the cache.
<!-- Todo: How safe is the last one...? -->

## Emulators (incl. Google Play Games)
Neither the game nor Hachimi support emulators. You can get them to work, but you're on your own. To play on PC, use the DMM or Steam client.
