Game translation and enhancement mod for UM:PD.

# Features
- **Advanced text formatting:** Hachimi comes with advanced translation features that help translations feel more natural (plural forms, ordinal numbers, etc.) and prevent introducing jank to the UI. 

- **Translates most in-game components:** No manual asset patching needed!
    Supported components:
    - UI text
    - Dynamic game text from master.mdb (skills, names, descriptions, effects, etc.)
    - Game dialogue (main story, home interactions, character stories, etc.)
    - Lyrics
    - Texture & sprite replacement
    - Video replacement
    - Internal game object adjustments
    - Hashed text fallback

    Additionally, Hachimi does not provide translation features for only a single language; it has been designed to be fully configurable for any language.

- **Easy setup:** Just plug and play. All setup is done within the game itself, no external application needed.
- **Translation auto update:** Built-in translation updater lets you play the game as normal while it updates, and reloads it in-game when it's done, no restart needed!
- **Built-in GUI:** Comes with a config editor so you can modify settings without even exiting the game!
- **Graphics settings:** You can adjust the game's graphics settings to make full use of your device's specs, such as FPS unlocking and resolution scaling.
- **Cross-platform:** Designed from the ground up to be portable, with Windows and Android support.
